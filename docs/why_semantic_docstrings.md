# Why Semantic Docstrings?

## 1. Syntax and Semantics

Traditional Python docstrings often repeat information that is already visible in the function signature or type hints. They tell *what* a function does, but not *why* it exists or how it should be used.  
Syntax alone expresses structure: arguments, types, and return values.  
Semantics express purpose: responsibility, context, and intention.  

For example, a function annotated with type hints shows that it accepts a `User` object and a `Decimal`, returning another `Decimal`. But it does not explain why these values are needed, how they should be interpreted, or what constraints apply. A semantic docstring complements syntax by capturing this meaning.  

## 2. Benefits for Developers

Semantic docstrings improve the human development workflow in several ways. They accelerate onboarding by making architectural roles and responsibilities explicit, so a new contributor can understand not only the implementation but also its purpose.  

They also enhance code reviews by shifting the discussion from *how the code is written* to *whether the code respects its defined responsibility and boundaries*.  
Refactoring becomes safer because semantic docstrings preserve intent: even if implementation details change, the documentation continues to record the original purpose and constraints.  

Finally, semantic docstrings reduce the need for separate design documentation. Since the architectural context, responsibilities, and boundaries are included close to the code, knowledge remains synchronized and accessible.  

## 3. Benefits for LLMs and Code Assistants

The adoption of semantic docstrings becomes even more relevant in an environment where large language models (LLMs) and code assistants participate in the development process.  

LLMs rely heavily on contextual information. While syntax gives structural cues, semantic docstrings provide anchoring: they state the purpose of a function or class before the model starts reasoning about implementation.  
This reduces ambiguity, preventing the model from making incorrect assumptions during refactoring or bug fixing.  

It also improves code completions. With clear documentation about responsibility, context, and boundaries, the model can generate suggestions aligned with architectural intent rather than generic patterns.  
Another key factor is information efficiency: high-quality semantic descriptions provide more meaning per token, optimizing limited context windows and making AI-assisted development more effective.  

## 4. Documentation Quality Threshold

Research shows that the effect of documentation on LLM performance is not linear.  
High-quality documentation can improve task accuracy by 20â€“50 percent.  
Incorrect or misleading documentation, however, is more harmful than having no documentation at all, often leading to performance degradation greater than 60 percent.  

This asymmetry indicates the existence of a quality threshold. Teams should therefore prioritize accuracy and clarity over coverage. It is better to document fewer functions well than to spread incomplete or misleading information across the entire codebase.  

## 5. Principles of Semantic Docstrings

Semantic docstrings follow several guiding principles:  

- **Responsibility**: Each module, class, or function should have a clearly defined responsibility that is explicitly documented.  
- **Context**: Arguments and return values should include information about their origin, meaning, and constraints.  
- **Boundaries**: The documentation should describe what the component does not do, making delegation and scope explicit.  
- **Role**: For classes and modules, the documentation should state their role within the system architecture.  

These principles ensure that documentation captures the architectural and semantic meaning of the code, not just its implementation details.  

## 6. Why Now?

The importance of semantic docstrings increases in the current landscape of AI-assisted development.  
Benchmarks such as HumanEval already integrate natural language as a core part of evaluating AI comprehension. The effectiveness of these benchmarks, and of AI systems in general, depends directly on the clarity of documentation.  

Semantic docstrings transform documentation into a semantic layer that supports collaboration between human developers and AI systems. They allow both to reason not only about how code works but also about why it exists.  
In this sense, adopting semantic docstrings is not only a matter of improving readability for developers but also a way to prepare codebases for effective collaboration with intelligent assistants.
